# SwiftUI Practices

Small SwiftUI examples with short explanations.  
Each folder is a separate Xcode project showing one idea.

## Examples

- `StateObject vs ObservedObject` – explained with clear usage
- `Binding Overload ??` – overload for optional bindings
- `Coordinator Pattern` – integrating UIKit in SwiftUI
- More coming soon...

## How to use

1. Clone the repo
2. Open any project in Xcode
3. Run and explore

No extra code. Just clear SwiftUI patterns.
